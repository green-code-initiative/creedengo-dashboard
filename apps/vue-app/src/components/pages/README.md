## Creedengo Pages and Dashboards

Creedengo Dashboards are "ready-to-use" dashboards that can be integgrated into one or more solutions.

They are meant to be usage oriented targeting end-user types like:

- Developpers when integrated in IDEs (VSCode, Android Studio, ...)
- Developers / Devops when integrated in CI tools (Jenkins, Gitlab, Github, Codepipeline, ...)
- Managers when integrated in tools like Confluence or dedicated Mobile apps
- Mixed when integrated in tools like Sonarqube

The larger the audience is, the more complex would be the dashboard as it means it should be more or less configurable, include filters or widgets selections...
