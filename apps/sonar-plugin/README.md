# Creedengo-Dashboard

_creedengo_ is a collective project aiming to reduce environmental footprint of software at the code level. The goal of the project is to provide a list of static code analyzers to highlight code structures that may have a negative ecological impact: energy and resources over-consumption, "fatware", shortening terminals' lifespan, etc.

## 🌿 SonarQube plugin

_Creedengo_ Dashboard WILL provides a Dashboard directly available from SonarQube to get an overview of the current sustainability impact of your project code. It WILL also highlight priority rules to fix.
