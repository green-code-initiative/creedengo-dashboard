    <p>A file that grows too much tends to aggregate too many responsibilities and inevitably becomes harder to
        understand and therefore to maintain. This
        is doubly true for a file with multiple top-level classes and interfaces. It is strongly advised to divide the
        file into one top-level class or
        interface per file.</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Avoid:</p>
    <pre>
            public class A {}
            public enum B {} // Noncompliant
            interface C {} // Noncompliant
        </pre>
    <p>Prefer:</p>
    <pre>
            public class A {
                string hello = "Hello !";

                public sayHello(){
                    System.out.println(hello);
                }
            }
        </pre>
