		Having a lot of fields per class is an indication that it has grown too large. Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor said class into smaller ones which focus on well-defined topics.

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Avoid:</p>
    <pre>
		class LotsOfFields {
    		public int field1;
    		public String field2;
    		private boolean field3;
    		protected char field4;
    		public double field5;
    		public Field field6;
			...
		}
	</pre>
    <p>Opt for:</p>
    <pre>
		class SomeFields1 {
    		public int field1;
    		public String field2;
    		private boolean field3;
		}

		class SomeFields2 {
    		protected char field4;
    		public double field5;
    		public Field field6;
		}
	</pre>
</div>
