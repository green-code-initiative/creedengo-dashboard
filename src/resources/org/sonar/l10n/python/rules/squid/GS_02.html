    <p>Empty methods will end up consuming CPU and RAM although they do nothing. Best is to get rid of empty functions, throw a relevant exception, or at least explain why function is empty in a comment.</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Avoid:</p>
    <pre>
        def doSomething():
            pass
    </pre>
    <p>Prefer:</p>
    <pre>
        def doSomething():
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException();

        def doSomething():
            pass # At least explain why nothing is happening yet
    </pre>
</div>
