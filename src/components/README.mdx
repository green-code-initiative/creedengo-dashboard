# Creedengo Design System and Widgets

This documentation provides an overview of the design system and widgets used in the Creedengo project.

## Design System

The design system follows an Atomic Design structure. [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) is a methodology for creating design systems that emphasizes the use of small, reusable components to build larger, more complex interfaces.

It provides pure visual components that can be used to build more complex components and widgets.

## Widgets

Widgets are standalone components binding visual components to feature services. 
They can use configurations and some parameters to target code analyse results.

They are meant to be used to create dashboards usable throught

- standalone built web or mobile applications (using Apache Cordova) 
- or integrated as 
  - a [Sonarqube plugin](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/2025.1/extension-guide/developing-a-plugin/plugin-basics/),
    - This project started as a migration of the Capgemini Greensight project to Ecocode (previous Creedengo name), and Creedengo is actually mostly provided as a collection of Sonarqube plugins, so this target is the most advanced one
  - IDE plugins like VSCode, Visual Studio, WebStorm, Android Studio, X-Code, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA,
    - Should help the developer to have more visual and textual information about the code quality issues in the code they are currently working on
  - linter html reporter plugins (as ones for ktlint, eslint, ...)
  - Confluence,
  - or for any other product.
