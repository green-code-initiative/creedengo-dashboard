# Vue.js HTTP API Client

## Vuex

[Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) was the **official** Vue state management solution and provides a solution similar to **Redux**.

The `api/` folder looks to be the convention pushed by Vuex for Vue.js applications to place the files fetching data from the server

## Pinia

[Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) comes as the **official replacement** of Vuex

It doesn't explicitely tell where HTTP API clients should be placed but its code examples looks to propose the same

## Test Vue.js App HTTP Request

The Vue.js comes with Vite and Vitest

Vitest recommend [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) to mock HTTP requests
